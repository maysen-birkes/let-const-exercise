1. What is the diiference between var and let?

var can reassign and redeclare a variable. For example if I was to do...

var pet = brody 

I can then redeclare it or reassign it later on in my code. And there will be no errors.

let however cannot do the same. Let can reassign, but it cannot redclare. Once a varibale is declared using let it cannot be redeclared. You would need to declare a whole new variable when using let. Let creates a block scope.


2. What is the difference between var and const?

var again can reassign or redeclare. const you cannot reassign or redclare, it is constant and will remain the same through out the entirety of your code. const aslo creates a block scope.


3. What is the difference between let and const

let can be reassigned where as const cannot be reassigned. const also cannot redeclare.


4. What is hoisting?

Hoisting is when variables are lifted to the top of their scope before they are declared. So that they can be declared later on. It is also considered a feature of var as you can access the variable name as well as it's undefined value before you use it later on.
